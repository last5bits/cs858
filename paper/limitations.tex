\section{Limitations}

The concept of search space is relevant only to search-based automatic repair tools (e.g., SPR~\cite{long2015staged}, Prophet~\cite{long2015prophet} or GenProg~\cite{le2012systematic}). The research community works on other approaches as well; for example, \emph{semantic-based} automatic repair (DirectFix~\cite{directfix}, Angelix~\cite{mechtaev2016angelix}), in which a repair produced by employing symbolic execution and constraint solving.

% Human bias in the empirical study
Since the empirical study is performed by the authors manually, there is a risk of human bias. We mitigated this risk by following a specific procedure when deciding whether a particular patch can be repaired by a tool.
