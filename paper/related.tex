Automatic repair of specifically mobile software is its infancy; the most related work is by Azim~et al.~\cite{azim2014towards}, their approach detects programs' crashes, immediately patches the bytecode of the program (to be certain that it won't crash again) and rolls the program state to the nearest activity. Automatic repair of desktop applications received more attention; the tool Prophet~\cite{long2015prophet} is a state-of-the-art technique that prioritizes potential fixes inside the search space by learning what correct \emph{developer} fixes look like. This direction is promising, however it highly depends on the data to learn from, which is not always present. Our approach of targeted search spaces is orthogonal to the one of Prophet.
