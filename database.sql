Successful exploitation could result in code execution as the wifiuser in Android.There are several mitigations that can effect successful exploitation of thisissue:- WLAN Direct is not enabled by default on most Android devices- Exploitation requires an attacker to be locally proximate (within WiFi range)- The wpa_supplicant process runs as the wifi user which has limited accessto the system- Remote exploitation is mitigated by ASLR on Android 4.1 and later devices.- The wpa_supplicant process is tightly constrained by SELinux policy onAndroid 5.0 and greaterThis issue is rated as High severity due to the possibility of remote codeexecution. While the wifi service does have capabilities that are notnormally accessible to 3rd party apps which could rate this as Critical, webelieve the limited capabilities and level of mitigation warrant decreasing theseverity to High.','2015-08-01'),(2086,'Memory Corruption in OpenSSLX509Certificate Deserialization','A malicious local application can send an Intent which, when deserialized bythe receiving application, can decrement a value at an arbitrary memoryaddress, leading to memory corruption and potentially code execution within thereceiving application.This issue is rated as High severity because it can be used to gain privilegesnot accessible to a third-party application.','2015-08-01'),(2087,'Buffer overflow in mediaserver BnHDCP','There is is a potential integer overflow in libstagefright when processing dataprovided by another application, leading to memory (heap) corruption andpotentially code execution as the mediaserver process.This issue is rated as High severity because it can be used to gain privilegesnot accessible to a third-party application. While mediaserver is guarded withSELinux, it does have access to audio and video streams as well as access toprivileged kernel driver device nodes on many devices that 3rd party appscannot normally access.Note that under our previous severity rating guidelines, this was rated as aModerate severity vulnerability and was reported to partners as such.
